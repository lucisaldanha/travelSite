## Basic Travel website

In construction... 

## How to use

Type command:
- node travelSite.js    // to run seb server

Open local host on browser.

### `Objective`

Create a static application using Express.js (server) and Handlebars( Express-Handlebars view engine).
The web page will be responsive. 

### `State we are at`

Server is running locally.
travelsite.js server has four routes, /home, /about, /404 and /500 routes. 
travelsite.js now has two more views, /newsletter-signup, /contest/vacation-photo routes.
Created views, a layout, a logo and a main application file.

### `Past steps`

- Create/test a simple http server.

- Add basic routes to server ( home, about, 404 not found, 500 internal error).

- Install Express.js framework.

- Add package.json to our project (npm init command).

- Install dependencies (npm instal command).

- Create a thank-you view.

- Add links to Navbar <a> tags.

- Add favicon icon.


### `Next steps`

- Previous experiences page;

- Home and About Us pages;

- Google Maps function, add in Home and maybe Previous Experiences;

- Fix newsletter form, size to be same as contest sign up;

- 404 page needs new format.

- 500 page needs new format.

- Newsletter-signup route needs email to be linked to, as Mailchimp.

- contest/vacation-photo route needs backend implementation (you can delete this route).

- /thank-you view needs to be implemented. It needs to be working with sessions (you can delete this route). 

- /news-thank-you view needs to be working with sessions/cookies. Right now, if person sign up for newsletter, page does not change and info stays there. We might need to change cache (you can delete this route).

- Database needs to be implemented, might use MongoDB.

- Connect server and database sucessfully.

- Deploy website on Github.

To be defined later.
