## The Local Spot website

The Local Spot is a high-fidelity prototype created to apply Interaction Design principles.
 - During the development, I took a user-centered approach, including users in the development of the interface, seeking users’ opinions and reactions into early designs.
 - Designed a simple and descriptive interface, avoiding cluttering of information that could distract the user.
 - Used blank spaces, borders, and color contrast to create an interface where users perceive and allocate items quickly.
 - Use of icons that help users distinguish information and how to use them (for example in the use of common known search and menu icons).
 - A interface that provides recognition by using menus, icons, and consistency throughout the interface (for example the sign-up and newsletter pages are similar).
 - High-fidelity prototype created using design principles, most noticeable is feedback, constraints, and consistency (for example the user can see the information necessary to fill forms to sign-up, and there is also feedback after sign-up or if the user didn’t add necessary information to perform the action).

Description of product:
Users receive recommendations from locals to travel and adventure that only locals know and go!  No more going into touristic and crowded places! 
Go Where the Locals Go...
